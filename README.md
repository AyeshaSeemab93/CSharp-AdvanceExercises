# C-Coding-Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C# exercises that were completed as part of the course at Helsinki Business College. The exercises were carried out in Visual Studio Code using the Test My Code (TMC) environment. If you haven't already set up the TMC environment, you can find instructions [here](https://www.mooc.fi/installation/vscode/#kirjautuminen-ohjelmointiymp%C3%A4rist%C3%B6%C3%B6n).
